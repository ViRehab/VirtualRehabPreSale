# About Virtual Rehab

Virtual Rehab's evidence-based solution leverages the advancements in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies for psychological rehabilitation of vulnerable populations (pain management, prevention of substance use disorders, enhancement of autistic individuals’ communication skills, and rehabilitation of repeat offenders).

Virtual Rehab's all-encompassing solution covers the following pillars:

- Virtual Reality - A virtual simulation of the real world using cognitive behavior and exposure therapy to trigger and to cope with temptations
- Artificial Intelligence - A unique expert system to identify areas of risk, to make treatment recommendations, and to predict post-therapy behavior
- Blockchain - A secure network to ensure privacy and decentralization of all data and all information relevant to vulnerable populations
- VRH Token - An ERC20 utility token that empowers users to purchase services and to be rewarded for seeking help through Virtual Rehab’s online portal

The VRH token has four use cases:
 
-	Allows users to order and download programs from Virtual Rehab Online Portal
-	Allows users to request additional analysis (using Virtual Rehab unique expert system, which uses Artificial Intelligence) of executed programs
-	Incentivizes users with VRH tokens reward for seeking help and counselling from medical doctors, psychologists, and therapists (Proof of Therapy)
-	Allows users to pay for services received at the Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (VRTC)

The VRH token's utility has been confirmed by a Maltese law firm to be a Virtual Financial Asset (VFA) and not a financial instrument per the below Tweet:
